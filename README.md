# alexrmann-test
Test space for Alex R. Mann design portfolio hosted on GitHub Pages.

Project status (2024.06.06):
-Content housed off site
-Building page templates
-Had to rebuild the main by adding back files that I had previously deleted. Bad practice, but I accomplished this by creating a new branch based on template-caption, then pulled that branch to main, then deleted the template-caption branch (as well as its copy). Consequently, files which may have began in main but were later deleted now appear as if they've just been added (i.e. they don't originate from their earlier counterparts). It's possible that branch commits weren't carried over. This was a consequence of me not understanding how git is designed to work. I simply wanted to "hide" files I wasn't working on in separate branches and which wouldn't ultimately become part of the main, but what I should have done was keep those files until I was satisfied with them (maybe in a separate folder) and copy their content to the main folder when ready, then delete the other files when no longer needed (or perhaps archive them).

Project status (2024.05.24):
